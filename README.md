# Description--Sound-Sep-
This is a "public" set repository with only the description of the acutal "Sound Sep" repository, which is set "private".

The repository is the main dump for all the code/side projects I worked on while on a Research Internship at Indian Institute of Technology-GN. 

The main project of this internship(this project), dealt with separating sources of sound in a music video. The prompt is similar to the classic Blind Source Separation problem with separating voices in a noisy room without much other knowledge. We mostly looked to separate  instruments (we tried to separate vocals, but we deemed it too difficult for the scope of this project later); using sound frequencies and repetitiveness of instrument usage as the main data/descriptions. 

Using a combination of frequency and some arbitrary function of time, we created a matrix of the song, to then slice that matrix and put them on top of eachother to create the "tensor" (multiple dimentional data). 

We then used multiple basic and complicated library functions and decompositions, combined with many types of neural networks to separate the said instruments.
